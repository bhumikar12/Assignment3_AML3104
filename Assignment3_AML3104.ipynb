    "### Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets, ultimately creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision, or a split based on one or more features.\n",
    "Here’s how the algorithm works to make to make predictions:\n",
    "- The algorithm starts with the entire dataset at the root node of the tree. It selects a feature and a threshold to split the data into two subsets. The selection of the feature and threshold is done in a way that minimizes impurity or maximizes information gain. Impurity is a measure of the disorder in a dataset.\n",
    "- The algorithm evaluates different features and thresholds to find the one that best separates the data. There are different methods for measuring impurity, including Gini impurity and entropy. The goal is to create subsets that are as pure as possible, meaning they predominantly contain one class of the target variable.\n",
    "- Once the first split is made, the same process is applied recursively to each subset at the next level of the tree. This splitting process continues until one of the stopping criteria is met, which could include a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples in a node, or a node with perfect purity (all samples in the node belong to the same class).\n",
    "- When a stopping criterion is met, a leaf node is created. Leaf nodes represent the final decision or class prediction for the samples in that node. The majority class in the leaf node is typically assigned as the predicted class.\n",
    "- To make a prediction for a new, unseen sample, the decision tree starts at the root node and follows the path through the tree by comparing the sample's feature values to the thresholds in each node. It continues down the tree until it reaches a leaf node, which provides the predicted class for the input data.\n"

    "- Entropy\n",
    "- Gini impurity\n",
    "- Information Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy: It measures the level of disorder in a dataset. Suppose the data is homogenous, meaning just one class or pure, the entropy of that dataset will be 0. Else, if the data is equally divided, the entropy of such data will be 1. Mathematically it can be expressed as:\n",
    "Entropy=∑_(i=1)^n▒Pi*log⁡(Pi)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity: The Gini impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element in the dataset. It has values between 0 and 1. A Gini index of value 0 means the data is perfectly homogenous whereas if the value is 1, it means the data is maximum inequality.\n",

    "### Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
    "A decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem where the goal is to determine which of the two classes the data point belongs to. This can be achieved by the following steps:\n",
    "- Collect and prepare your dataset. It should contain labeled examples, where each data point is associated with one of the two binary classes. Each data point consists of features (independent variables) and a corresponding class label (dependent variable), which is either one of the two classes.\n",
    "- Start with the entire dataset at the root node of the tree.\n",
    "- Select the best feature to split the data in a way that maximizes information gain. This feature can be determined by using various criteria like Gini impurity, entropy etc. \n",
    "- The dataset is divided into two subsets based on the selected feature and threshold, and the process continues recursively for each subset. This process continues until the tree has met the maximum depth or the nodes are completely pure.\n",
    "- When the decision tree reaches the leaf nodes (also known as terminal nodes), each leaf node is assigned a class label. In binary classification, each leaf node should be assigned either the class label 0 or 1 based on the majority class of the data points in that node.\n",
    "- For a new, unseen data point, you start at the root node of the decision tree. You compare the feature values of the data point to the feature and threshold of the current node. Depending on the comparison, you follow the appropriate branch of the tree to the next node. This process is repeated until you reach a leaf node. The class label associated with the leaf node is the prediction for the binary classification problem.\n"

    "In email spam classification, the goal is to classify whether the incoming emails are spam (positive) or not (negative). The precision is an important metric to optimize here. i.e. to reduce the number of false positives. This is crucial because false positives could incorrectly classify a legitimate email as spam and have it moved to the spam folder to be deleted. This can result in the loss of an important email. Whereas reducing the false negatives is not as crucial here because even if the spam emails are not identified, the harm caused is much less than the other scenario.\n"

False negatives in a medical setting occur when a patient who has the disease is incorrectly classified as not having the disease.
